## About
This is a small side project to collect data about average heart rate values and store them. The intention is that over time data can be used in meaningful ways to track heart healthiness and provide insight into possible health related issues and notify users before they are aware.

What has brought this about was an article I recently read which mentioned that when average resting heart rate has increased in the short term could indicate potential oncoming illness. Whilst there's only initial science behind this, it's more for me to get a better handle on the Go programming language whilst providing health data to me about my heart rate.

The name of the project is a play on words. It watches your HR (heart rate) and the reading comes from a smart watch. :smile:
